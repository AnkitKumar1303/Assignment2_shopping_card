explanation:

Basic Html structure with every divsion of the content and heading.
A div element contains the main content, applying the class "container w-2/5 p-2 bg-[#F7F6FA]." 
This class controls the width, padding, and background color of the product card.
div with the class "flex font-sans bg-white rounded-lg" serves as a flexible container for the product card layout.
A form element with the class "flex-auto p-6" is employed to structure the product details section.
There's a button section for both "Buy Now" and "Add to Bag" options,
and these buttons are styled using classes for padding, borders, and text colors.
